These determinants can be seen as the buttons one needs to push in order to establish behaviour change. Insight into these determinants is needed to select behaviour change methods (i.e., general behaviour change techniques that are applied in an intervention) in the development process. Therefore, a study on determinants is often conducted as formative research in the intervention development process. Ideally, all relevant determinants identified in such a study are addressed by an intervention. However, when developing a behaviour change intervention, there are limits in terms of, for example, resources available for intervention development and the amount of content that participants of an intervention can be exposed to. Hence, it is important to select those determinants that are most relevant to the target behaviour as these determinants should be addressed in an intervention. The aim of the current paper is to introduce a novel approach to select the most relevant social-cognitive determinants and use them in intervention development. This approach is based on visualization of confidence intervals for the means and correlation coefficients for all determinants simultaneously. This visualization facilitates comparison, which is necessary when making selections. By means of a case study on the determinants of using a high dose of MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy), we illustrate this approach. We provide a freely available tool to facilitate the analyses needed in this approach.","tags":[],"title":"Using Confidence Interval-Based Estimation of Relevance to select social-cognitive determinants for behaviour change interventions","type":"publication"}]
